b. A user with auditor role can navigate to both &quot;Dasboard Page&quot; and
&quot;Audit Page&quot;. A user with auditor role should always navigate to
&quot;Audit Page&quot; first and can navigate to &quot;Dasboard Page&quot; from the

current login of the user should be recorded.
Please clone the repositories to perform the task.
• You need to checkout one UI repository on to your local system
UI Based on your preference choose one
- Angular https://gitlab.com/byteridge/interviews/angular-ui-project-
new
- React.js https://gitlab.com/byteridge/interviews/react-ui-project-new
- Vue.js https://gitlab.com/byteridge/interviews/evaluation-demo-
web-vue-vuex.git 

Please read the following instructions carefully and follow
sequentially.
• Following is the existing behaviour of the code :
User can login and logout, register as a normal user and as an audit user.
• Following are set of tasks you need to complete to be successful in this
round
1. On Login :
• User with AUDITOR role should always navigate to audit page
first and can navigate to dashboard page from the top menu.
• User without AUDITOR role can navigate to a dashboard page
and does not see a button to navigate to the audit page.

2. Within the “Audit” pages:

•  Data is displayed as a list - Implement a table with pagination – use
a Data Table to display the data along with pagination, sorting (for
username,firstname , lastname) and search( by name)
• Format date as DD/MM/YYYY hh;mm:ss, add a dropdown above the
table to change date/time format from 12hr to 24hr. (Created Date is
coming in the response of the API called)

Once you have completed the tasks commit your code (API) to separate public
repository on GitHub/Gitlab/Bitbucket Zip the source code folders and share in email.
